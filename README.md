Project YARA is an idea to make a cheap, easy to DIY, modular robotic arm. This is version 1.0 (if i could even call it that) and there is certainly a lot of place for improvement. Robot arm is almost fully 3D printable, and build with common hardware available from Amazon, eBay, DigiKey, Mouser...
Firmware of the arm is based on STM32 microcnotroller, and implemented on STM32 developement board in order to avoid PCB manufacturing.
Controll software for the arm is written in Python, for ease of use, and ROS2 software package was used for inverse kinematics calculation and for graphical preview of the robot.

THIS PROJECT IS UNDER NO LICENCE AND PLEASE DOWNLOAD IT AND TRY IT OUT :D.
